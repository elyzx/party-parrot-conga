# Party Parrot Conga

## Objective 

Create a simple in-browser game with three states (start screen, game play and game over) and the ability to restart. 

## Technologies 

The game must be created using HTML, CSS, Javascript (Canvas, DOM, Basic JS, Classes) and a version control tool (Git/Github). Bonus: include local storage and audio.

## Description

Party Parrot Conga is a fun new twist on the classic Snake game. We've removed the Snakes and replaced them with lovely Parrots that are there to party with you. The rules are simple, don't crash into the Conga or leave the Party. The longest Conga wins.

## MVP
- The game starts with a Parrot Conga (consiting of two parrots) moving fowards into the middle of the perimeter. This is so the Parrot Conga does not immediately collide with the perimeter. 
- The user can change the direction of the Parrot Conga using the Left and Right keys. The Parrot Conga always turns 90 degrees per key press.
- A Lonely Parrot is placed in a random location within the perimeter. It should not be directly next to the perimeter or ontop of the Parrot Conga.
- When the Parrot Conga collides with the Lonely Parrot, the Parrot Conga gets longer and another Lonely Parrdot appears. 
- As the Parrot Conga gets longer, the game gets more difficult. 

Win Condition: If 10 Lonely Pardots are added to the Conga, the user is taken to the Winning Screen.

Lose Condition: If the Parrot Conga collides with itself or the perimeter, the user is taken to the Game Over screen.
